# 30 Plants

This tool lets me track the plant products I eat.

But more than that, I wanted to try developing an entire app using vibe coding.

### Prompt Used 

Create an app that lets me track all the plant products that I eat. 

The UI should I have two parts: 

The main list. I should be able to create multiple lists as I want - The default title of the list (which is also editable) should be in the format of '2025 W13 March 23-March 29'.

When I add items to the list, they should come in a numbered format. 

Another part is collections. If I create a collection of X items, when I add the collection name to as an item in the main list, it should add all the items in the collection to that list.

There should be a view that shows all the lists present with the count of items in each list. 

as well as another view which shows all the collections with the number of items in each collection. 

All the data should be stored in the local storage of the browser. This app should run entirely from the browser without any server. 

I will need a settings page which has the ability to export and import the entire data in format of JSON. 

### Next Steps

When viewing a list, once the edit button is pressed, there should be an option to delete the entire list with confirmation
